Rubicon (GameMaker Version)

A personal project inspired by the C++/SDL assignment.

Last modified June 2016.

Rubicon is a simple SHMUP game that I was working on until I realized I don't really like GameMaker Language (GML). This was my second attempt at developing a game. I programmed with GML using GameMaker Studio 1.4. Every asset is temp and I'm not sure about the state of the code. I currently have no plans on revisiting this project.
